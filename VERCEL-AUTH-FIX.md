# ðŸ”“ Fix Vercel Authentication Issue

Your API is deployed but protected by Vercel auth. Fix this:

## Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click your "subscription-pro" project
3. Go to Settings > Functions
4. Disable "Vercel Authentication" or set to "No Authentication Required"

## Option 2: Make Functions Public
Add this to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/index.py": {
      "runtime": "@vercel/python"
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 3: Test Direct URL
Try: https://subscription-2428usffc-manishs-projects-e4683bf1.vercel.app/api/

## Quick Test:
Your API is working but needs auth disabled in Vercel dashboard.

**Go to Vercel dashboard and disable authentication for functions.**
