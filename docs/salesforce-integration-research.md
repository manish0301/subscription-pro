# Salesforce Commerce Cloud B2C Integration Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive research and analysis of Salesforce Commerce Cloud B2C integration methods, specifically focusing on how to integrate a subscription management platform like SubscriptionPro with Salesforce B2C Commerce. The research covers integration approaches, technical implementation strategies, API capabilities, and best practices for creating seamless e-commerce subscription experiences.

## 1. Introduction to Salesforce B2C Commerce Integration

Salesforce B2C Commerce (formerly Demandware) is a cloud-based e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create unified, personalized shopping experiences across all channels. The platform is designed with integration at its core, allowing merchants to connect various third-party services to enhance the shopping experience [1].

The Salesforce B2C Commerce platform is fundamentally built around integrating various third-party services to create exceptional shopper experiences. These integrations typically include checkout services such as tax calculation, shipping providers, payment processors, product information management systems, and specialized services like subscription management platforms [1].

Each B2C Commerce merchant and project has unique integration requirements. As technical architects, it's critical to fully understand each integration interface and summarize data inputs and outputs comprehensively. This requires developing a strategic approach and applying integration best practices to ensure scalable and stable applications [1].

## 2. Integration Interfaces and Methods

### 2.1 Core Integration Interfaces

Salesforce B2C Commerce provides several key interfaces for third-party integration:

**Web Services Framework**
The Web Services framework is a primary integration tool available within Business Manager that helps manage calls to web services and analyze service performance. This framework is particularly suited for real-time, synchronous integrations where immediate data visibility or updates are required [1].

**Scheduled Jobs Interface**
The scheduled jobs interface, also available within Business Manager, is designed for asynchronous integrations where real-time data updates are not necessary. This interface is ideal for batch processing operations such as catalog imports, order exports, and customer data synchronization [1].

**Headless/Commerce API**
The Headless/Commerce API provides programmatic access to B2C Commerce functionality, enabling developers to build custom frontend experiences while leveraging the platform's backend capabilities. This API is particularly valuable for creating mobile applications or custom user interfaces [1].

**Open Commerce API (OCAPI)**
OCAPI is a RESTful API that provides comprehensive access to B2C Commerce data and functionality. It supports both Shop API (for storefront operations) and Data API (for administrative operations), making it a versatile choice for various integration scenarios [1].

### 2.2 Integration Strategy Considerations

**Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Integration**

Synchronous integration occurs in real-time, ensuring immediate data visibility or updates. This approach is implemented using the Web Services framework, where B2C Commerce storefront request processing is suspended until the third party responds or times out. Synchronous integration is recommended for stateless third-party designs such as loyalty points display, tax calculation, and real-time order history views [1].

For subscription management platforms, synchronous integration would be appropriate for:
- Real-time subscription status checks
- Immediate subscription modifications
- Live pricing calculations for subscription products
- Instant subscription activation upon payment

Asynchronous integration happens at specific scheduled times and is suitable when real-time data views or updates are not necessary. This strategy is implemented using data files or web service/API calls and is ideal for:
- Bulk subscription data exports
- Customer data synchronization
- Product catalog updates
- Subscription analytics and reporting

**Push vs. Pull Data Transfer**

The choice between push and pull mechanisms depends on which system initiates the integration:

Push Method: The data source initiates the transfer. For example, a subscription management system could push subscription status changes to B2C Commerce via the Data API when subscriptions are modified, paused, or canceled.

Pull Method: The data destination initiates the transfer. For instance, B2C Commerce could pull subscription data from the subscription platform during scheduled batch operations to update customer profiles or order history.

**Client-Side vs. Server-Side Integration**

Client-side integration occurs in the browser layer and is typically used for tracking, tagging, and direct third-party service integration. Examples include ratings/reviews widgets, captcha verification, and maps integration. Client-side integration provides an asynchronous experience using Ajax and is suitable for non-sensitive subscription features like subscription preference widgets or customer feedback forms.

Server-side integration is necessary when login credentials, secret tokens, or data persistence is required. This approach is essential for subscription management platforms that need to:
- Securely access customer subscription data
- Process subscription payments
- Maintain subscription state in search indexes
- Integrate with backend subscription logic

## 3. Integration Principles and Best Practices

### 3.1 Loose Coupling Architecture

Loose coupling is a fundamental principle where system components have minimal interdependence and make little use of knowledge about other components. This approach provides fault tolerance and makes integrations more robust by reducing the risk when one system experiences downtime [1].

For subscription management integration, loose coupling means:
- The subscription platform can operate independently if B2C Commerce is temporarily unavailable
- B2C Commerce can continue basic operations even if the subscription service is down
- Changes to either system don't require extensive modifications to the other
- Integration failures are gracefully handled with appropriate fallback mechanisms

### 3.2 Fault Tolerance Strategies

Effective integration assumes that any connection has the possibility of failing. To minimize risk, it's essential to determine how integrations can overcome failure situations and identify the expected impact on the shopping experience. The fault tolerance strategy varies depending on whether the integration is in a critical path [1].

For subscription platforms, critical path integrations include:
- Subscription status verification during checkout
- Payment processing for recurring subscriptions
- Subscription activation after successful payment

Non-critical path integrations include:
- Subscription analytics and reporting
- Customer preference synchronization
- Marketing campaign data updates

### 3.3 Transfer Server Implementation

Transfer servers facilitate data exchange between B2C Commerce and third-party systems. When implementing transfer servers, files and data must be consumable by all connected systems. Most implementations support multiple data types including product, customer, coupon, and tax data [1].

For subscription management, transfer servers would handle:
- Subscription product catalog synchronization
- Customer subscription history exports
- Recurring order data transfers
- Subscription analytics data exchange

## 4. Salesforce Commerce Cloud Cartridge Development

### 4.1 Understanding Cartridge Architecture

Salesforce Commerce Cloud uses a cartridge-based architecture for extending platform functionality. Cartridges are modular components that contain business logic, templates, and configuration files. They provide a structured way to implement custom functionality while maintaining compatibility with the platform's upgrade cycle [2].

The Subscribe Pro cartridge implementation demonstrates a comprehensive approach to subscription management integration. The cartridge is available in two versions: one for SiteGenesis (SG) architecture and another for Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA), ensuring compatibility with different B2C Commerce implementations [2].

### 4.2 Cartridge Structure and Components

Based on the Subscribe Pro cartridge repository analysis, a typical subscription management cartridge includes the following components:

**Core Cartridge Structure:**
- `cartridge/` - Main cartridge directory containing business logic
- `package.json` - Node.js package configuration for build processes
- `steptypes.json` - Job step definitions for scheduled processes
- `.project` - Eclipse IDE project configuration

**Key Functional Areas:**
- Controllers for handling subscription-related requests
- Models for subscription data management
- Templates for subscription user interfaces
- Scripts for data synchronization and batch processing
- Hooks for payment processing integration

### 4.3 Payment Integration Strategy

Subscribe Pro's approach to payment integration demonstrates best practices for subscription platforms. The cartridge works with existing payment gateways and credit card vaults, ensuring that subscription orders use the merchant's existing payment processor integration and card vaulting systems. This approach eliminates the need for credit card migration and maintains consistency with existing payment workflows [2].

For SubscriptionPro integration with Salesforce B2C Commerce, this means:
- Leveraging existing Razorpay integration for payment processing
- Maintaining payment method consistency between one-time and subscription orders
- Utilizing B2C Commerce's built-in payment tokenization capabilities
- Ensuring PCI compliance through existing payment infrastructure

### 4.4 Hosted Widgets and User Experience

The Subscribe Pro cartridge provides hosted widgets to enhance the customer experience when interacting with subscription data. These widgets include:

**My Subscriptions Page:** A hosted page that allows customers to view and manage their existing subscriptions. This page can be styled to match the merchant's current theme and provides comprehensive subscription management capabilities [2].

**Wallet and Address Book Widgets:** These widgets maintain synchronization between customer address and payment instrument records in both Subscribe Pro and SFCC, ensuring customers can use their existing data with their subscriptions [2].

For SubscriptionPro implementation, similar hosted widgets would provide:
- Subscription dashboard with real-time status updates
- Payment method management with Razorpay integration
- Delivery address management with Indian address format support
- Subscription modification interfaces (pause, resume, skip, cancel)

## 5. Open Commerce API (OCAPI) Integration

### 5.1 OCAPI Architecture Overview

The Open Commerce API (OCAPI) is a RESTful API that provides comprehensive access to Salesforce B2C Commerce data and functionality. OCAPI is divided into three distinct APIs, each serving different integration purposes [3]:

**Shop API:** Enables client interaction with the system as a shop customer or as an agent shopping on behalf of a customer. This API provides access to public shop information such as product and catalog data, images, recommendations, prices, and promotions [3].

**Data API:** Provides create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) access to system resources such as coupons, customer lists, slot configurations, and content. This API requires authentication through OAuth tokens [3].

**Meta API:** Retrieves formal descriptions of the Open Commerce API resources and documents, including custom attributes [3].

### 5.2 OCAPI Authentication and Security

OCAPI requires proper authentication for all requests. The authentication mechanism varies depending on the API being used:

**Client ID Requirement:** All OCAPI requests require a mandatory client ID that must be configured in the B2C Commerce Business Manager. This client ID serves as the primary identifier for the requesting application [3].

**JWT Authentication:** For Shop API requests that require customer context, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to authenticate registered or guest customers [3].

**OAuth Authentication:** Data API requests and Business Manager user context operations require OAuth tokens for authentication [3].

### 5.3 OCAPI Integration Strategies for Subscription Management

For SubscriptionPro integration with Salesforce B2C Commerce, OCAPI provides several integration opportunities:

**Customer Data Synchronization:** Using the Data API to synchronize customer information between SubscriptionPro and B2C Commerce, ensuring consistent customer profiles across both systems.

**Product Catalog Integration:** Leveraging the Shop API to access product information and pricing data for subscription products, enabling real-time product availability and pricing updates.

**Order Management Integration:** Utilizing both Shop and Data APIs to create and manage subscription orders within the B2C Commerce order management system.

**Personalization Integration:** Using the Shopper Context API to enable personalized subscription experiences, including customized promotions, pricing, and shipping methods [3].
